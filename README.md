# Obsidian Filename Linter Plugin

## Using the Plugin

### Manual Invocation

This plugin adds two commands.

`Filename linter: Lint the current filename`
`Filename linter: Lint all filesnames in the vault`

The renames are regular Obsidian renaming calls and will follow your vault settings for updating internal links (Prompted or Automatic).
Be prepared to be patient if you have a large vault with many required renames.

### Automatic Linting

Not yet available.

### Credits

We are grateful to the developers of Obsidian for the [Obisidan Sample Plugin](obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin) for the basis of this plugin, and to [Obsidian Filename Emoji Remover Plugin](https://github.com/YTolun/obsidian-filename-emoji-remover), whose code we read and experimented with before diving into writing our own plugin.

## Installing the Plugin

### Manul Install

1. On the command line, navigate to your vault's `.obsidian/plugins` directory and run:
   `git clone https://github.com/rocketnova/obsidian-filename-linter`
2. In your Obsidian vault, enable this project from the Community Plugins setting section
3. Set up your preferred character replacements in the Filename Linter Community Plugins section

### Community Plugin Directory

## Developing the Plugin

### Initial Setup

1. Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
2. Create a sandbox Obsidian vault
3. In the sandbox Obsidian vault, enable Community Plugins. This should create a `plugins` dir
4. In the `plugins` dir, install the [Hot Reload plugin](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) (optional; strongly suggested)
5. In the `plugins` dir, git clone the project
6. In the cloned project dir, install node v18.x
7. In the cloned project dir, install the dependencies: `npm install`
8. In the cloned project dir, start dev mode: `npm run dev`
9. In the sandbox Obsidian vault, enable this project and the Hot Reload plugin

### Developing

When developing, ensure you are running `npm run dev` to keep the project building changes.

### Testing

No tests are currently setup.

### Linting

- To use eslint with this project, make sure to install eslint from terminal:
  - `npm install -g eslint`
- To use eslint to analyze this project use this command:
  - `eslint main.ts`
  - eslint will then create a report with suggestions for code improvement by file and line number.
- If your source code is in a folder, such as `src`, you can use eslint with this command to analyze all files in that folder:
  - `eslint .\src\`

### Obsidian API Updates

For updates to the Obsidian API run `npm update` in the command line under your repo folder.

### Releasing new releases

- Update your `manifest.json` with your new version number, such as `1.0.1`, and the minimum Obsidian version required for your latest release.
- Update your `versions.json` file with `"new-plugin-version": "minimum-obsidian-version"` so older versions of Obsidian can download an older version of your plugin that's compatible.
- Create new GitHub release using your new version number as the "Tag version". Use the exact version number, don't include a prefix `v`. See here for an example: https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin/releases
- Upload the files `manifest.json`, `main.js`, `styles.css` as binary attachments. Note: The manifest.json file must be in two places, first the root path of your repository and also in the release.
- Publish the release.

> You can simplify the version bump process by running `npm version patch`, `npm version minor` or `npm version major` after updating `minAppVersion` manually in `manifest.json`.
> The command will bump version in `manifest.json` and `package.json`, and add the entry for the new version to `versions.json`

### Adding your plugin to the community plugin list

- Check https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/plugin-review.md
- Publish an initial version.
- Make sure you have a `README.md` file in the root of your repo.
- Make a pull request at https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases to add your plugin.
